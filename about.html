            My name is Peder (it rhymes with <span class="pronounce name-pronounce">cheddar</span>) and as of writing this I just
            graduated from Virginia Tech with a Master's in Computer Science and Applications back in December 2024.  I got my Bachelor's in Computer Science
            from James Madison University.
