                First things first: lets discuss things from my last post:
                <ul>
                    <li>I made a basic python tkinter quiz, that's the end of that journey</li>
                    <li>I have not made a new flutter project yet, but...</li>
                </ul>
                I like mahjong.  And I made a <em>very</em> <a href="https://github.com/pizzadeliverymen/Mahjong">mahjong js game</a>
                in entirely base html/css/js.  I started with no frameworks to test my js skills. Unfortunately, I didn't plan ahead
                while making it and so the styling only really works with at least a 1920 pixel wide screen.
                Along with that, I started it in a single .js file and refactoring it into multiple js files left much to be desired.
                Especially concerning the timing of the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I'm going to remake it in a new image.   A flutter-er image.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm starting from scratch using flutter.  And theoretically I could release it as a mobile app, or a standalone program.
                That's not necessarily the goal but if I manage to complete the game it looks nice to have a multi- platform release.
            </p>
            <p>
                And if you're wondering which mahjong style I'm going for, my original project was the Japanese Riichi Mahjong, but
                that get's pretty complicated pretty quickly, so I'm going to make this new flutter-y mahjong in the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong#Old_Hong_Kong_mahjong_rules">Hong Kong Old Style,</a> as that seems
                to be recognized as one of the least complicated variants.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/pizzadeliverymen/FlutterMahjong">Here is the new git repo for the flutter-y mahjong.</a>  
                I'm starting smarter this time, as I plan to build the mahjong game first using the console, and <em>then</em> add ui elements.
