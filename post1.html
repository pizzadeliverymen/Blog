                So what's been going on recently in my Software Development journey?
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly, I fixed a few (many) things wrong with the <a href="https://BigBookstore.peders.me">BigBookstore</a>,
                as it turns out I had forked an older version on accident when I moved it to aws hosting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Notable Updates:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fixed backend management of "purchases" (previously the frontend always assumed nothing went wrong)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added button to autofill personal info with dummy data for testing.  It's still there in the live
                        version as the website is used as a proof of concept instead of an actual bookstore, and it's
                        reasonable that someone testing my website wouldn't trust personal info/credit card management.
                        &lpar;TODO: remove errors after pressing autofill button&rpar;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed some minor css issues, including removing unused css files and adding more transitions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also been learning Flutter, as I saw a few job postings that required it.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I made a quick <a href="https://github.com/pizzadeliverymen/BasicFlutterApp">flutter project</a> or
                <a href="https://github.com/pizzadeliverymen/RecipeSite">two</a>.  So far (and I'm pretty early on in
                learning) the most difficult thing seems to be making layouts look pretty, and even then a quick google
                search showed that I could convert Figma to a Flutter layout, which may be my next step.  (Side Note: I haven't
                decided which flutter project to continue or if I would make an entirely new project).
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also been thinking, and realized that most of my projects fall under web (or mobile) development, and
                I should probably try to create a more standalone project.  Unfortunately, I am kinda bad at ideas, so 
                when I think of something, I will probably just make a new post about it. (and maybe update this post as well).
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm kind of leaning towards a game, but I'm not sure if I want to use a full game engine or something like pygame 
                (which I guess is still technically  game engine) or if I should just do gui elements.  That does raise a point though,
                in that I've never worked with python GUI before, so maybe I should try that out first.  I could make a simple quiz game
                to test it out and go from there.  And the first result on google mentioned tkinter, so that's where I'll start.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hopefully I update this blog soon with a complete quiz game, but for now, 
                <a href="https://github.com/pizzadeliverymen/pyquiz">here's the repo</a>!
